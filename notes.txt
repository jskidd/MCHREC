To Do:

- Fill in the following empty tables:

3 records at least


modulars
modular_cardlist (linking)
traits
card_traits
villains
villain_cardlist (linking)


reverse engineer send it all (ALL of it he's not afraid)

create erd diagram and send that as well

attempt to throw in bad data to prove that data types matter and I'm catching the right things

PowerPoint showing everything off
doesn't need to be over the top (I'll just show off hero synergy)





We have to keep in mind that the /public/cards/ API call only returns player deck card, including campaign cards.

Therefore for completeness we will want to go through every single pack call in the API as well.

All of the player cards are marked as we expect: "faction_code":"agg-basic, hero

faction code "campaign" 

faction_code:"encounter" represents both villain and module cards

"card_set_type_name_code":"modular" for scenario, "villain" for encounter



So it seems we have quite the decision tree for this crap

First we check faction code.

faction_code = "hero", dump into card version and master card

faction_code = "agg" through "basic", check for "duplicate_of_code"
  if exists, dump in card version and link to master
  if not, dump in card version and master

faction_code = "campaign", check value of "card_set_type_name_code"
